# Kotlin DSA & Programming Challenges 🚀

Welcome to my Kotlin study repository!

This is where I consolidate everything I’ve learned and practiced related to:

- **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**: Classic implementations like sorting, searching, trees, graphs, binary Search, exponetial Search etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Recursion, memoization, and classic problems such as Fibonacci, Knapsack, Climb Stairs, etc.
- **Challenge Solving**: Fully tested solutions for challenges from **LeetCode** and **HackerRank**.
- **Benchmarking**: Execution time measurements to compare different algorithmic approaches.
